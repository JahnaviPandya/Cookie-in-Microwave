This is my 1 minute cookie recipe in microwave

First step is to mix all dry ingredients and then add the milk.
Usually cookies look brown due the use of brown sugar but you can use white sugar too, it won't make any difference in taste only the color will become white than brown.
Make a ball out of the dough and place it on parchment paper and microwave it.
Remember not to over bake the cookie.
Every microwave is different so the cooking time should be between 1 minute to 1 minute 15 seconds.
Once it comes out of microwave it should be very soft.
You can eat the cookie as a midnight craving or eat it with ice-cream.
